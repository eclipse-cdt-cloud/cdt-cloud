# Eclipse CDT Cloud

CDT Cloud hosts components and best practices for building customizable web-based C/C++ tools.
As a demonstration of how these components can be integrated with each other, CDT Cloud provides a template tool named *CDT Cloud Blueprint*. For more information, please also visit the [project website](https://www.eclipse.org/cdt-cloud).
